				Thank you, Barry!
				
				  
				That bee is living my life!
				
				  
				Let it go, Kenny.
				
				  
				- When will this nightmare end?!
				- Let it all go.
				
				  
				- Beautiful day to fly.
				- Sure is.
				
				  
				Between you and me,
				I was dying to get out of that office.
				
				  
				You have got
				to start thinking bee, my friend.
				
				  
				- Thinking bee!
				- Me?
				
				  
				Hold it. Let's just stop
				for a second. Hold it.
				
				  
				I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
				Oan we stop here?
				
				  
				I'm not making a major life decision
				during a production number!
				
				  
				All right. Take ten, everybody.
				Wrap it up, guys.
				
				  
				I had virtually no rehearsal for that.
				
				Special thanks to SergeiK.
